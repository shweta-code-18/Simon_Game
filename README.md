## 🧐 About
The goal of the game is to memorize and repeat a sequence of tones and lights. The game creates a series of signals (colors/sounds), starting with one. The player must repeat the sequence correctly. If the player succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.

## ✨ Features
* **Interactive UI:** Responsive buttons with visual animations (flashing).
* **Sound Effects:** Distinct sounds for each of the four colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).
* **Game Logic:** Random sequence generation that increases in difficulty every level.
* **Game Over Handling:** Visual cues (background flash) and reset functionality when a mistake is made.
* **Keyboard Support:** Start the game by pressing any key (desktop) or tapping the screen (mobile).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling, Flexbox/Grid for layout, and animations for button presses.
* **JavaScript:** Game logic, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and array management.
